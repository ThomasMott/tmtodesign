The project was very developer focused. It involved me learning how the blockchain has become programmable with smart contracts, little pieces of automatically-executing code running on the blockchain. It also involved creating a hosted website where people could learn about the project and purchase the NFT's.

## Goals

The main goal of the project was to learn more about cryptocurrency, the blockchain, NFT's and improve my skills as developer. As this was one of my biggest solo projects, one of the major challenges was being able to develop a solution that had the necessary functionality for the project.

To ensure the outcome was successful, the website and designs were tested with prospective customers over several iterations.

## Outcome

The outcome was a fully responsive website and a random algorithmically generated composite PNG image maker built in Node JS. The final NFT's are available both on the website and on OpenSea.io
