**Genshare was a UK service based in Loughborough. The main goal of the project was to improve the lives of elderly people following the Covid-19 pandemic.**

A range of different tools were used to frame the behaviours, pains, motivations and goals of users. This allowed us to identify the best opportunities to relieve these pains and add value to users.

The main goal of the project was to improve the lives of elderly people following the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the biggest challenges was conducting research with no direct access to users. The data gathered related to primary data collection _(books, personal sources, journals, newspapers, websitess, government records)._
