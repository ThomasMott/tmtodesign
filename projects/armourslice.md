The design process followed the double diamond model, the biggest focus for this project was improving the usability and efficiency of the current armourslice cable stripping tool. I also needed to ensure the final product was feasible for mass manufacture.

## Initial concept sketches

I created a range of concepts using a refined success criteria. The tool was required to fit into confined work spaces while remaining ergonomically sound. Through questionnaires, interviews and prototype testing I refined the idea to maximise usabilty.

## Goal

The goal was to improve the function and efficiency of the C.K tools' current line of armourslice SWA cable strippers.

## Outcome

The research, specification and final concept were taken for development and manufacture by the C.K product development team.
