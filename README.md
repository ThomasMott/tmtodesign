# Website repository

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. 

If you want to add a post to FoxGibbon then simply add ```{postName}.md``` into the ```/posts``` directory. 

Posts require a title: *string*, name: *string*, tldr: *string*, time: *string*, image: *string*, tags: *array*, date: *YYYY-MM-DD* and layout: *layouts/post.njk*. These are set at the top of the markdown file, see existing posts for more.

If adding media please add into ```/static/images/blog``` and create a new folder with the same name as your .md file.

Once everything is added run Eleventy (more below on that) and your post will be converted to html.
