				<h2>TL;DR.</h2>
				<p>I'm a <strong>user experience</strong> / <strong>user interface</strong> specialist, and <strong>front-end developer</strong>. I am also available for illustration.</p>

			<h2>About.</h2>
			<p>Located in <strong>Bristol</strong>, England. I have worked as a freelance consultant in the past and am always interested in impactful opportunities. This can be from accessibility audits, to wireframing or coding front-end components.</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>High-level accessibility audits to understand areas for improvement, focused on best-practices, WCAG compliance, and practical next steps</li>
				<li>User experience content writing</li>
				<li>Wireframing and interactive prototypes</li>
				<li>Creating design language and component libraries</li>
				<li>Developing new and implementing new components improvements and bugfixes <em>(or advise the team on the improvements)</em></li>
				<li>Conducting user testing and synthesizing data into actionable opportunities</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Previously, I have worked in-house in start-ups and small businesses, where I focused on designing and building intuitive front-ends. I have also worked as a graphic and product designer.</p>
			<p>My strength has always been in multidisciplinary roles. I excel at performing audits and reviews, engaging in user testing, writing design system libraries, and getting hands-on with front-end development. And in engineering projects I typically take on a double role as ux designer/front-end developer.</p>

				<h3>Accessibility &amp; heuristic reviews.</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>Struggling to manage WCAG compliance as your product scales?</p>
				<p>I can do a detailed or high-level accessibility / heuristic review, and based on the outcomes suggest fixes and next steps.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Front-end development.</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>As a front-end developer and designer I can wireframe, prototype and build products that are user friendly, accessible and scalable.</p>
				<p>I can build accessible websites and prototypes, make improvements to existing products, or work to implement new features.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Wireframing &amp; prototyping.</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>Got some ideas and just want to see what a new feature will look like?</p>
				<p>I can create one one-off or batch prototypes using Figma and Adobe CC that you can share with your team or with users to test.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Creating design systems.</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>I build good looking, user-friendly and responsive design systems using the <a href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/">Atomic Design Methodology</a>. I can run the process from start to finish, and design directly to code.</p>
				<p>I enjoy challenges involving different ways of working and visualising data and content, and have a lot of fun writing creative CSS / JS.</p>
