As the lead of Mojeek's website redesign, I spearheaded a comprehensive process that spanned over two years. With a focus on accessibility and user-centered design, the redesign journey aimed to enhance the website's usability and deliver an exceptional user experience. As a team, we embarked on a journey that involved various stages, including accessibility and heuristic reviews, user interviews, SUS testing, guided observation, and more.

## Research: Laying the Foundation

To gain valuable insights into user needs and preferences, we conducted user interviews, engaging directly with representative users to understand their motivations, goals, and pain points. These interviews formed the foundation for informed design decisions and helped shape the redesign strategy.

Quantitative measurements of usability were obtained through System Usability Scale (SUS) testing, coupled with guided observation to gather real-time feedback from users. This iterative process allowed for continuous refinement and enhancement of the website's design, informed by user insights and preferences.

Throughout the two-year duration, findings from accessibility and heuristic reviews, user interviews, SUS testing, and guided observation were diligently collected and analyzed. Miro, an online collaboration platform, facilitated the organization and visualization of data, enabling me to prioritize and address identified issues and opportunities for improvement.

## Prototyping: Designing the User Experience

Prototypes and mock-ups were created iteratively, ensuring that design concepts were thoroughly explored and refined using Figma and Adobe XD. Concurrently, design system templates were developed to ensure consistency and efficiency throughout the design process, reinforcing a cohesive visual identity.

## Testing: Iterating for User Feedback

The website redesign process also incorporated a limited release to a community of users, allowing for iterative testing and continuous feedback. This approach ensured that the redesign met real-world usage requirements and evolving user expectations.

Notably, new features were introduced, including the implementation of personal search engines, which enabled users to customize their search experiences based on their preferences. These additions aimed to deliver a more personalized and tailored search journey, differentiating Mojeek from its competitors.

## Outcome

As a result of the comprehensive redesign efforts, Mojeek experienced significant growth in its user base, with the user count more than doubling over the two-year period. This expansion reflected the success of the redesign in attracting and engaging users, who responded positively to the improved accessibility, enhanced usability, and the personalized search experience. <a href="www.mojeek.com">See the live website here</a>.
