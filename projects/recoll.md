Education 4.0 is a purposeful approach to learning that lines up with the fourth industrial revolution and about transforming the future of education using advanced technology and automation.

The design process followed the double diamond model. The primary focus of this project was providing value to users _(university students with high workloads)_ as well as making sure that the final output was feasible for developers. This required extensive multidisciplinary team working to ensure a productive and purposeful Artificial Intelligence.

## Process

Key insights from the initial research and discovery phases were achieved using literature reviews. Once we had developed some initial insights we tested them using storyboarding, observation and interviews.

Initial wire-frames were sketched out on paper so team could get a mutual understanding of how the app would flow. The wire-frames were then transferred into Adobe Xd to create something more interactive and tangible.These designs were influenced by Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui">User Interface, Navigation</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout">Layouts</a>.

To make sure the prototype was suited to the defined users we sat down and observed them using the app, noting down key challenges and usability issues that were gathered using think aloud protocol.

## Goals

The main goal of the project was to improve the university experience for those who were not feeling supported.

The greatest challenge faced during the project was to provide this support without having a negative impact on the existing university services or increasing the workload of users _(students)_. A secondary challenge was ensuring the Artificial Intelligence was relevant to the product and that data was handled ethically.

These were achieved with user testing and liaising with developers during the ideation, wire-framing and iteration stages.

## Outcome

Independent testing with the student body showed that participants felt the project was beneficial to the university experience and supported their education development.
