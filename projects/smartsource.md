**Smartsource is a UK start-up based in Bristol. It's an all-in-one platform that allows small businesses to trade and share resources with its own marketplace.**

With Smartsource, you have a single app where you can easily market your extra resources, communicate with other companies, and even create wishlists for new materials. This project has already secured significant interest, and the sky is the limit for its potential.

The concept, sitemap, wireframes and early design were shaped by research, interviews and first hand ethnographic research with participants from SME's _(small, medium enterprises)_. This produced a wealth of rich qualitative data.

Data was compiled and synthesised into key usability problems. This information was supported by creating customer journey maps, storyboards and mapping out user journeys.

Once the idea was supported, rigorous website UX testing and analysis of communication and website structure was used to shape the service. Once we established this strong foundation, we proceeded to create a more robust brand and design that truly served their business goals.

## Outcome

Companies involved in the process were incredibly happy with the final outcome and the prospects that the platform could offer them. <a href="https://gcza99.axshare.com">View the live prototype here</a>.
