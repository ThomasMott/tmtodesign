**Coalition for Competitive Digital Markets aims to advance fairness and stronger openness in digital markets, allowing businesses of all sizes to compete on fair grounds.**

CDM hired me to assist with their rebranding and to help improve the UI of their website, aiming to enhance their visual appeal.

Initial discussions were made with clients to define what their values and motivations were.
