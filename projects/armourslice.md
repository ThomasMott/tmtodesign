**C.K tools are at the forefront of producing high quality hand tools for trade professionals.**

The focus for this project was improving the usability and efficiency of the current armourslice cable stripping tool, while ensuring the final product was feasible for production.

A range of concepts were created using a refined success criteria. The tool was required to fit into confined work spaces while remaining ergonomically sound. Through questionnaires, interviews and prototype testing I refined the idea to maximise usabilty.
