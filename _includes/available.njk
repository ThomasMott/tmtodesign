				<h3>Creating design systems.</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>I build good looking, user-friendly and responsive design systems using the <a href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/">Atomic Design Methodology</a>. I can run the process from start to finish, and design directly to code.</p>
				<p>I enjoy challenges involving different ways of working and visualising data and content, and have a lot of fun writing creative CSS / JS.</p>
