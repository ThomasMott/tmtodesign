**Tails.com are well known for their quality dog food offerings but we were challenged by the company to condut research into other revenue streams that they could look to expand into with their existing customer base.**

Emphasis was placed on research and discovery for this project, to find unique insights and emphasise the needs of the user. We utilised many research methodologies during this time _(card sorting, interviews, observation)_.

As this was a project with a quick turnaround. We ran a week long design sprint to iterate the app in collaboration with users. This was an excellent experience to work in a fast paced design environment.

Through research phases it was found that there was a gap to improve the lives of people who are caring for multiple pets. 

As pets are considered to be "part of the family", one of the biggest challenges was conducting research respectfully. The data gathered related to personal lifestyle choices of the owners regarding their pets. Whilst being respectful and open, we also had to gather enough detail to produce a purposeful
design solution.

To ensure that all the information was thoroughly reviewed personas, experience maps and storyboards were used. This helped to ensure that the most meaningful insights, with the greatest value to users could be collated.

Prototypes were extensively tested with defined target users.

Our team produced a high fidelity prototype app that linked key care components for each pet onto one system. Owners could easily access pet services such as veterinarians and petsitters, set tasks and routines for their pets; and while away, delegate those tasks to relevant carers remotely to monitor progress.

The deliverables were handed over to Tails to continue development in house.
