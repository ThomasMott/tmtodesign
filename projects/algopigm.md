**Algopigm was a UK start-up based in Worthing. It's an all-in-one platform that allows small businesses to trade and share resources with its own marketplace.**

The project involved me creating a set of unique and fun NFT's as well as a hosted website where people could learn about the project and purchase them.

## Goals

The main goal of the project was to learn more about cryptocurrency, the blockchain, NFT's and improve my skills as developer. As this was one of my biggest solo projects, one of the major challenges was being able to develop a solution that had the necessary functionality for the project.

To ensure the outcome was successful, the website and designs were tested with prospective customers over several iterations.

## Outcome

The outcome was a fully responsive website and a random algorithmically generated composite PNG image maker built in Node JS. The final NFT's are available both on the website and on OpenSea.io
